Fitpeo Assignment
For this assignment, I used Eclipse as my Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and ChromeDriver for the Chrome browser.

The test execution was managed using TestNG, and I wrote the test scripts in Java. To run the tests, I created a testng.xml file, which allows you to execute the entire test suite by running just this single file.

I organized the project into multiple class files for better structure:

.I created a separate class file for locators.
.I also created another class for handling Explicit Waits.
.To compare the actual and expected results, I used Assertions.
You can run the tests simply by executing the testng.xml file.
